# Data Science + UX Research Case Studies

This repo contains anonymized, product-style decision memos that show how I frame problems,
choose methods, define metrics and guardrails, run studies (remotely and in person), and 
translate results into recommendations and next steps.

## Case studies
- **Remote A/B-style experiment: incentives and information detection**
  - [case-studies/remote-ab-test.md](case-studies/remote-ab-test.md)

## What you’ll see in each case study
- Problem framing and decision to make
- Research questions and hypotheses
- Method selection
- Metrics, instrumentation and data-quality checks
- Analysis and interpretation
- Recommendations and follow-ups
